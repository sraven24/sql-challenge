# sql-challenge

For this challenge, I analyzed several csv files from the employee files of a large company.  Using pgadmin, a database was created and each csv file was turned into a table as part of a relational database.  Using the database imager, QuickDBD, a map of the database was created to illustrate how all the tables are interconnected.  Several queries were done to retrieve answers to several questions about the various employees of the company.

# Installation
This queries can be run if you have copies of the various csv files.  The QuickDBD-sql-diagram.png gives you a visual of the database setup while the QuickDBD-sql-diagram.sql is a copy of the query used to create and connect the tables.  All queries required to be answered for this project are listed in the sql_challenge_queries.sql and can be run in pgadmin or like sql database interface.

# Resources
All files listed above are in the EmployeeSQL folder within Github.
